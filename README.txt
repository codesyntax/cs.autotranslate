cs.autotranslate
=================

Do you go mad when creating images and files in Plone that
you want to use through the different languages' sites?

In previous versions of Plone did you create a 'neutral'
folder and store there your images?

Forget everything!!!

Just create a folder, apply AutoTranslatable interface using
Sub-Typer menu, and tadaaaaaa! All items created inside that
folder will be translated automatically to all available
languages.

Only available for Archetypes based content.
